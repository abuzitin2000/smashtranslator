# Smash Translator
## _A chrome extension that translates smash lingo into fgc ones_

## Features

- Have you ever saw someone write "This Ky ditto is amazing" and then get confused what a Ky ditto is? Well this extension is for you!. It translates lingo used by smash bros players so you understand what they are talking about.

I don't play smash bros so some translations might be missing. If you find one I missed, please tell me so I can add it to the list.

## Installation

Google store requires a fee to upload extensions. I didn't wanna give money to google so this is a guide to install extensions without the google store.

_If you want to upload this yourself to the store, feel free to do so._

```sh
Download repository as zip
Unzip the rar
Open the extensions page in your browser
Check the Developer mode slider on the upper righ corner of your browser screen
Click the LOAD UNPACKED button on the upper left side of your browser screen
Select the unzipped folder
You can uncheck the Developer mode if you like
```
